üêç What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simple syntax, readability, and versatility. 
It supports dynamic typing and automatic memory management, making it ideal for rapid application development.
Although Python is primarily interpreted, its source code is first compiled to bytecode before being interpreted by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).
This gives Python the benefits of both compilation and interpretation.
