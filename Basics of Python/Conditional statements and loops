 1. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else): Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your program based on certain conditions.
Basic Syntax:
if condition:
    # code block
elif another_condition:
    # code block
else:
    # code block
Example code:
age = 18

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age == 18:
    print("You just became an adult!")
else:
    print("You are an adult.")

#Key Points
Use indentation (4 spaces) to define the block under if, elif, or else.

You can have multiple elif blocks, but only one else block.

if executes the first block where the condition is True.

2.Loops:Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly.

# For Loop
Basic Syntax:
for variable in sequence:
    # code block
Example code:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Using range()
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # prints 0 to 4

# While Loop: Executes the block as long as the condition is True.
Basic Syntax: 
while condition:
    # code block
Example code:
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

ðŸ”¸ Loop Control Statements:
| Statement  | Description                               | Example               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `break`    | Exits the loop entirely                   | `if x == 3: break`    |
| `continue` | Skips current iteration and moves to next | `if x == 3: continue` |
| `pass`     | Does nothing (placeholder)                | `if x == 3: pass`     |

Use of continue example code:
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue  # skip 3
    print(i)
Use of break example code:
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break  # stop at 3
    print(i)

Summary table of for loop and while loop:

| Feature          | `for` Loop              | `while` Loop                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Use case         | Iterate over a sequence | Run while a condition is true |
| Stops when       | Sequence ends           | Condition becomes False       |
| Can use break    | âœ…                       | âœ…                             |
| Can use continue | âœ…                       | âœ…                             |
