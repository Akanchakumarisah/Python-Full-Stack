✅ Python Syntax: Syntax refers to the set of rules that define how a Python program is written and interpreted.
1.No need for semicolons ; or curly braces {}
For eg: 
if age > 18:    print("Adult")
2.Indentation is Mandatory: Default is 4 spaces (or 1 tab). All lines within the same block must be indented equally.
def greet():
    print("Hello")
    print("Welcome!")
3.Statements end with a new line: You don’t need ;, but can use it to write multiple statements on one line:
x = 5; y = 10  # Not recommended
4.Case Sensitive: print, Print, and PRINT are different in Python.
x = 5       # int
x = "five"  # now a string


✅ 2. Comments in Python
Single line comment: we can give single line commwnt with # symbol
eg: # Let's Learn Python

Multi-line Commen: For multi line comment we have to use """ """ symbol
eg: """"We are learning python full stack
and our mail goal to complete it in 2 months""""
