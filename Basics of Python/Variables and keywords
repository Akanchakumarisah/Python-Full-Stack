Variables: Variables are containers for storing data values.

Rules for Naming Variables in Python:

Start with a letter (Aâ€“Z or aâ€“z) or an underscore (_)

Do not start with a digit (e.g., 1value is invalid)

Use only letters, numbers, and underscores (_)

No spaces allowed (use underscores instead)

Do not use special characters like @, #, $, %, etc.

Case-sensitive (e.g., age and Age are different)

Do not use Python reserved keywords (like if, class, while, etc.)

Use descriptive names (e.g., student_name, not just s)

Follow snake_case naming convention for readability

Constants are written in UPPERCASE by convention

Variable Declaration in Python:
x = 10          # int
pi = 3.14       # float
is_active = True  # bool
message = "Hello" # str

KeyWords: Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings. They are part of the syntax of the language and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers.
